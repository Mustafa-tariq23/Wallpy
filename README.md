## Highlights
- Wide range of genres including abstract, anime, nature, architecture, retro, and more.
- Dedicated folders for animated images, animated videos, and mobile-friendly portrait assets.

## Get Started
1. Clone the repository (recommended for offline browsing):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/qhd-wallpapers.git
   ```
2. Or download the latest archive from the GitHub web UI (`Code → Download ZIP`).
3. Point your wallpaper manager to the extracted folder, or copy favourites into your OS-specific wallpapers directory.

## Finding The Right Wallpaper
- Use your file explorer's search to filter by keywords that appear in filenames (e.g., `sunset`, `forest`).
- Preview folders containing a `README.md` directly on GitHub to see a clickable gallery of thumbnails.
- Animated assets live under `animated-images/` (GIF/WebP) and `animated-videos/` (MP4/WebM). Ensure your wallpaper app supports the format before applying.
- Mobile-ready assets are kept in `Mobile/` so you can sync them to your phone without resizing.

## Contributing
- Prefer source files that are at least 2560×1440 (16:9) or higher. Portrait pieces for `Mobile/` should be 1080×1920 or better.
- Use descriptive, dash-or-underscore-separated filenames; avoid spaces and special characters.
- Drop new artwork into the closest matching category. If nothing fits, place it in `unsorted/` and open an issue proposing a new folder.
- When adding a large batch to a folder that already has a gallery README, regenerate the HTML snippet (anchor + `<img>` tags) so previews stay up to date.
- Only contribute content you have rights to share. Credit original artists in commit messages or subfolder READMEs when possible.

## Attribution & Usage
All wallpapers remain the property of their respective creators. Please verify licensing terms before using any asset commercially or redistributing outside this repository. If you are an artist and would like your work removed, open an issue or submit a takedown request including file paths.
